# Poetic Whispers

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), featuring a Ghibli-inspired poetry collection.

## About the Project

**Poetic Whispers** is where classics come to life. This application celebrates the enduring magic of the greatest poets in history, bringing together masterpieces of literary icons like Shakespeare, Edward Thomas, and more. We offer a curated sanctuary for those who cherish the elegance of words that have stood the test of time.

The visual aesthetics are inspired by Studio Ghibli films and the serene matsu (pine) design philosophy, creating a peaceful and nostalgic environment for enjoying timeless poetry.
